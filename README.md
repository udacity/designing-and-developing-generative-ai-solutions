# Purpose of This Repo

This repo is meant to be used to keep things organized during content development and act as the source of truth for all exercises related to this content.

## Environment Requirements and Installation

Fill out the requirements.txt file and describe all dependencies for students to be able to install and run all dependencies for the entire repository.  Add local installation instructions for students. Optionally, add and explain any additional requirements and dependencies (datasets, databases, operating system packages or resources) in this readme file. 
## Folder Structure

This repo contains a folder for each `exercise`.

Example
```
exercise-1-hello
exercise-2-world
exercise-3-foo
exercise-4-bar
```

Each `exercise` folder is named using the naming convention of `exercise-#-name-of-exercise`.

Example
```
exercise-1-hello
```

Five exercises folders have been provided as a template; However, you may need to add more or possibly use less depending on what is needed.

If you require an additional exercise folder, you can make a copy of the folder and paste it into the root directory.

### Exercises Folder

Each `exercise` folder should contain all files and instructions necessary for the exercises along with the solution. The solutions for these exercises will be shared with students. See the `README` in the `exercises` folders for information about folder structure.

### Environment Requirements and Installation

Fill out the requirements.txt file and note all package dependencies.  Optionally add and explain any additional requirements (datasets, databases, operating system packages) in this readme file.
